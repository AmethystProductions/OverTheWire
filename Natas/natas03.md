# natas3

I'm not sure if this is the normal way. Since the source said something about Google. I just remember to use `site:http://natas3.natas.labs.overthewire.org/` to figure out the directories that exist in on the url. Which gives me `/s3cr3t/` and there's a `users.txt` within.

Ahh ok. So I was supposed to use `robots.txt`. :(
